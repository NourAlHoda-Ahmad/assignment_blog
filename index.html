                <p>Africa, the second largest continent (after Asia), covering about one-fifth of the total land surface
                    of Earth. The continent is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by the
                    Mediterranean Sea, on the east by the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, and on the south by the mingling
                    waters of the Atlantic and Indian oceans.</p>

            <div><p>As of 2022, Africa exhibited a population density of 48.3 individuals per square
                kilometer. At the beginning of 2000, the population density across the continent has experienced a
                consistent annual increment. Projections indicated that the average population residing within each
                square kilometer would rise to approximately 54 by the year 2027. Moreover, Mauritius stood out as the
                African nation with the most elevated population density, exceeding 640 individuals per square
                kilometre. Mauritius possesses one of the most compact territories on the continent, a factor that
                significantly influences its high population density.</p> </div>

                    <p> Cairo is by far the largest city in Egypt. 
                        An additional 9.5 million inhabitants live close to the city. 
                        Cairo, like many other megacities, suffers from high levels 
                        of pollution and traffic. The Cairo Metro, opened in 1987, 
                        is the oldest metro system in Africa,
                        and ranks amongst the fifteen busiest in the world,with over 1 billion
                         annual passenger rides. The economy of Cairo was ranked first in the Middle East in 2005,
                        and 43rd globally on Foreign Policy's 2010 Global Cities Index.</p>

                          one of the Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages. Alexandria was the intellectual and cultural

                        It was at one time the largest city in the ancient world before being eventually overtaken by Rome.</p>

                    <p>Abidjan is the largest city and the economic capital of the Ivory Coast.
                        The city expanded quickly after the construction of a new wharf in 1931, followed by its designation as the capital city of the then-French colony in 1933. The completion of the Vridi Canal in 1951 enabled Abidjan to become an important sea port. Abidjan remained the capital of the Ivory Coast after its independence from France in 1960. In 1983, the city of Yamoussoukro was designated as the official political capital of Ivory Coast.
