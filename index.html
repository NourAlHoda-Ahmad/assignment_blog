                <p>Africa, the second largest continent (after Asia), covering about one-fifth of the total land surface
                    of Earth. The continent is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by the
                    Mediterranean Sea, on the east by the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, and on the south by the mingling
                    waters of the Atlantic and Indian oceans.</p>

            <div><p>As of 2022, Africa exhibited a population density of 48.3 individuals per square
                kilometer. At the beginning of 2000, the population density across the continent has experienced a
                consistent annual increment. Projections indicated that the average population residing within each
                square kilometer would rise to approximately 54 by the year 2027. Moreover, Mauritius stood out as the
                African nation with the most elevated population density, exceeding 640 individuals per square
                kilometre. Mauritius possesses one of the most compact territories on the continent, a factor that
                significantly influences its high population density.</p> </div>

                        and cultural centre in Sub Saharan Africa.Due to the large urban population and port traffic
                        volumes, Lagos is classified as a Medium-Port Megacity.</p>
